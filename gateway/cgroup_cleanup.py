    reaches: the gateway stops its own scopes from inside the process, so a gateway that
    was SIGKILLed never runs that funnel, and the next gateway has a new PID.

    The units are *enumerated* rather than derived from the gateway's PID record, because
    ``$MAINPID`` is unset in ``ExecStopPost`` (``man systemd.service``; measured on
    systemd 255, including a stop that hit the ``TimeoutStopSec`` escalation) and the
    record is a weaker signal than it looks: a concurrent status read with
    ``cleanup_stale=True`` can unlink a stale record before this hook runs, and a
    ``--replace`` unlink no-ops when the record already names the new process. Each unit's
    own name carries the PID that issued it, so a live gateway keeps its scopes by
    construction and a dead one's are stopped without needing any record at all.

    Returns True when at least one unit was stopped. Best effort by construction: an
    unreachable manager, an unnameable unit, or a liveness answer that cannot be resolved
    means no stop, and enqueuing a stop is not proof that the scope is gone before
